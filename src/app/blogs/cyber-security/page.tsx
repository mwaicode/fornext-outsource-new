        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">The Rising Threat Landscape</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Cyberattacks have become more sophisticated, with AI-driven hacking, phishing, ransomware, 
          and data breaches becoming more prevalent. Organizations must strengthen their security posture 
          to mitigate risks and ensure compliance with new regulations.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">Top Cybersecurity Best Practices</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-600">
          <li>**Zero Trust Security Model** – Implement strict access controls and continuously verify user identities.</li>
          <li>**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Require users to verify their identity with multiple authentication factors.</li>
          <li>**Regular Security Audits** – Conduct frequent penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.</li>
          <li>**Data Encryption** – Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
          <li>**AI-Powered Threat Detection** – Utilize AI-driven security tools to detect and respond to threats in real-time.</li>
          <li>**Employee Training** – Educate employees on recognizing phishing attacks and maintaining good cyber hygiene.</li>
          <li>**Backup and Disaster Recovery Plans** – Ensure critical data is backed up and can be restored in case of an attack.</li>
        </ul>
